# VirtualProject - Virtual world demo project
### Overview
VirtualProject is my first multiplayer attempt. I tried to clone games like Club penguin, CP-world etc.
This project is using Unity, Mirror and Playfab for the Backend (BaaS).

I've hosted this project on my website for a few years and open sourced it due to management complexity and management costs to run this game server.
Offline mode of this project available at my website: https://virtualproject.noamsapir.me/

## Deployment

To deploy this project. You should install Unity 2020.3.43f1 and compile 2 versions.
1. Linux headless build (Server).
You would need to configure SSL if the web server will use https.
Read Mirror WebSockets Transport for that: https://mirror-networking.gitbook.io/docs/manual/transports/websockets-transport

2. WebGL (Client).
